This webpage conveys the two-sentence story below:
"You forgot to lock the door."
She heard in a whisper, from under her bed.

Two events are:
1. 'click':
- turning the lights off -> button disappears when 'click' happens
- changing the opacity of furniture in the room

2. 'scroll':
- text "You forgot to lock the door." flickering depending on the position of the scrollY
note: I initially wanted the scrollY to affect the opacity of the text starting at around 1000px height(where the bed image ends) of the window and opacity to go from 0 to 1. However, the flickering text worked better with the spooky feel, and I decided to keep it as it was.
